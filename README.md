# Project 2 data

GitHub Classroom won't let you create a repo from the template, because the data file is too large. I've uploaded it here instead -- you can download it from here by cloning this repo on your computer, for example, or clicking "Code" > "Download ZIP".

Make sure you put the file in the same folder as your project notebook!
