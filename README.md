# Project 2 data

GitHub Classroom won't let you create a repo from the template, because the data file is too large. I've uploaded it here instead -- you can download it from here by cloning this repo on your computer, for example, or clicking "Code" > "Download ZIP".

Make sure you put the file in the same folder as your project notebook!

### Other resources

**27th November 2020**: the [road traffic interactive data portal](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/3) has been down for maintenance/upgrading for a couple of days. In the meantime, you can still download road traffic data [on the UK's open data portal](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/208c0e7b-353f-4e2d-8b7a-1a7118467acc/gb-road-traffic-counts) if you need to. Note that the "Raw counts" file available there is the same data as you already have, but for the *whole UK* instead of just Scotland. There are also AADF data and shape files for the road network.

You can also find [other transport statistics and data](https://data.gov.uk/search?filters%5Btopic%5D=Transport) on the open data portal.

The DfT also produces yearly reports using the road traffic data, [which you can find here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/road-traffic-estimates-in-great-britain-2019), and which contain a lot of summary statistics and visualisations. You can take a look at these reports if you'd like some inspiration for your own project.
